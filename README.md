# ANTLR-Compiler
A compiler written in Java which compiles Yapl (Yet Another Programming Language) to JVM Bytecode.
The parser was generated with ANTLR and the compiler uses multiple of the by ANTLR recommended interfaces for interacting with the parsetree.
A profiler which extends the compiler was created since the compiler finished early.
